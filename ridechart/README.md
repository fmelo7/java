# ridechart

I have this sample code I've made with spring boot and angularjs, using yeoman generators, nodejs and bower. Just download it and `maven install`.

## Usage

1. The sample files to upload are in `src/test/resources` folder; 
2. Go to Upload menu to load files; 
3. And than go to Activity and choose the activity you want to show in chart.

## Download & build with maven

Run `mvn install` will run all steps of building application 

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for build and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
